Here's some examples of what the current prompts look like with corresponding data input and output as of 21/11/2025. You can use this to rewrite the book generation prompts. Since all the strings for prompt generation are spread throughout request_book_content.py, I would suggest you rewrite them by CTRL-F-ing the specific part of the text you want to change. I didn't get any examples with written_content references but those put in the entire text and some context basically.

TEXT OUTPUT:
A vermilion shriek, a feathered flame,\nIt sears the air from whence it came.\nThis <a href=\"civilization_id/102\">civilization</a>'s gilded trace,\nA cold and unforgiving face,\nInterrupts the conatus will,\nAnd leaves the striving spirit still.\nThe <a href=\"historical_figure_id/349\">intellect</a> dissects the day,\nAnd turns all living flux to clay,\nA spatialized and deadened scheme,\nA bureaucrat’s pathetic dream.\nWhile matter, stubborn, will not yield\nTo meanings that our fictions wield.\n\nO, macabre dance of bone and breath,\nWhere reason illuminates our death!\nThe condemned consciousness, so grand,\nStands silent in the wasted land.\nIts quiet dignity, a sneer\nAt all we manufacture here.\nThis vile, ornate, and vicious lie,\nThat we might grasp and never die,\nIs purified to ash and cinder,\nBy this celestial reminder.

TEXT OUTPUT:
The sterile, silvered silence sings a psalm,\nWhere saline solutions seek to still the screams.\nThe body, <a href=\"historical_figure_id/550\">a patient slate</a>, is scraped of dreams,\nA territory traced by tremor-teams.\nThe penal panopticon, a prism’s gleam,\nRefracts the will to power, raw and real,\nA laboratory’s cold, diagnostic zeal\nThat maps the meat, a desiccated scheme.\n\nThe <a href=\"civilization_id/38\">ancient networks</a>, fungal, fine, and deep,\nNow mimic veins where mineral whispers creep.\nThis clinical cathedral, vast and vaulted,\nHolds truth in tubes and data, never faulted.\nA macabre machine, a grisly grace,\nEtches new morals on the human face.\nThe tranquil soul, a concept left for dead,\nAs new gods rise from hospital and bed.\nThe sands will tell of this, our grim design,\nWhen all our branching, brilliant paths align.

"The dirt can say, this clod of <a href=\"civilization_id/28\">Athenian</a> clay,\nThat logic is a reflexion of the day’s\nRelentless grind. The universal will\nIs just the factory’s hum, the silent drill\nThat carves the watershed, a branching vein\nOf capital, a systematic pain.\n\nThe helm of darkness isn't some god's art,\nBut the sheer number on the profit chart.\nThe dragon Ladon, guarding golden fruit,\nIs the stalled system, putting down its root\nIn every breath. The fragile, floating spheres\nOf social foam confirm our deepest fears.\n\nYet still, the dirt can say, the stubborn weed\nPushes through cracks, fulfilling its own creed.\nA witless, metonymic, grinding fight—\nA bit of grit that blunts the infinite night.\nThe dirt can say it perseveres. It stays.\nAnd turns the whole machine, another day.
